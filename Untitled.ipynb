The insight we do have on Magic Beans comes primarily from user experience and potency reports. What is most commonly said about Magic Beans OG is that it has a relaxing physical high thatâ€™s perfect for kicking back and snacking on a few things at the end of a long day. It does have some heady effects although mild and relaxing including a lifted effect that boosts your mood at the onset of the high. A buzzy body high will be present throughout the duration of the high leaving you sedated and in a state of sleepy calm. Thanks to these effects Magic Beans OG is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as chronic pain anorexia or appetite loss chronic fatigue and insomnia. This bud has a sharp flavor of minty earth and an aroma to match although it does infuse scents of dank pine and chemicals into the mix as the nugs are burned. Magic Beans OG buds have long lima bean-shaped minty green nugs with long thin amber hairs and a super thick frosty coating of milky clear crystal trichomes.',\n",
